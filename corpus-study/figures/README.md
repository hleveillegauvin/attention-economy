__Figure 1.__ Relationship between the year a song appeared on the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 chart and
a) the number of words in its title (r = –.27, p < .001), b) its main tempo, in BPM (r = .18, p = .002), c) the elapsed time before the voice enters, in seconds (r = –.36, p < .001), and d) the elapsed time before the title of the song is mentioned, in seconds (r = –.18, p < .001). For Figure 1a, dots of varying sizes have been used to illustrate overlapping data points, as indicated by the graph’s legend. These tests remain significant after a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of .01 per test (.05/5). Not shown is the lack of correlation between the year a song was popular and its self-focus score (r = .01, p = .897). The results are consistent with the attention economy principles.
